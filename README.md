# course-booking-app
Android app coded from scratch by myself, @achawathe, @EricVan14, @noobstang and @michaeltsoon. This app will "implement a basic course selection service for students and instructors. Students will be able to search for a course, instructors will be able to edit details about their own course, and an administrator will manage users and courses." Coded for SEG2105.
